# Vehicle Speed Estimation
Estimating the speed of a vehicle given its camera image using Computer vision techniques and Deep Learning.
I have planned to use 2 type of Neural Network models
1. Convolutional neural network CNN
2. CNN feature extraction and RNN

## Project Board
### Data Processing
- [x] Data exploration
- [x] Crop image and resize 
- [x] Standardize labels
- [x] to Numpy
- [x] Train Test Split
- [x]  to Tensor
- [x]  Data Loader
- [x] Transforms for image tensors(Normalize, .....)

### CNN - Label Model
- [x] Transfer Learning CNN-Label
- [x] Training Loop 
- [x] Testing Loop
- [x] Choose best architecture and pretrained model

### CNN - RNN - Label Model
- [x] Transfer Learning CNN-RNN-Label
- [x] Training Loop 
- [x] Testing Loop
- [x] Choose best architecture and pretrained model
